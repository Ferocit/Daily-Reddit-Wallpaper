# Daily Reddit Wallpaper (on startup)
This script changes your wallpaper to most upvoted image of the day on /r/wallpapers or from any other subreddit.


**Run it on startup for new wallpaper on every session.**

*Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10.*

Dependencies
=======
Make sure you have Python installed and PATH variable set.

Ubuntu
------
If you don't have ```pip ``` for Python:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

You will need modules ```requests``` and ```praw``` installed, which can be done running following commands:

```
pip install requests
pip install praw
```

Windows
------
Follow [this guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install  ```pip```  and configure PATH variable.
The rest is the same.

``` 
py -m pip install requests
py -m pip install praw
```

Using script
=======

Simply run:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py 
```

If you wanna use other subreddit, include argument with the subreddit name:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py --subreddit earthporn
```

If you don't want to change your wallpaper daily, you can use top weekly, monthly or yearly wallpaper too by adding argument ```week``` or ```month``` or ```year``` to the script.

Example:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py --time week 
```
